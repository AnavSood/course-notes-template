# Lecture two {#sec-lecture-two}

This page covers the material from the second lecture. 

## Some things we referenced in lecture one

Here's a another definition, that we already referred to previously in @sec-lecture-one.

# Another definition 
This is another definition.

If we want, we can also recall @def-prime from the previous lecture. 

And here is another TikZ diagram, that we already referred to in @sec-lecture-one.

```{r, engine='tikz'}
#| label: fig-smiley-face
#| fig.cap: "A big smiley face"
#| echo: false
#| out.width: '60%'
#| fig.align: 'center'

\begin{tikzpicture}
  % Face
  \draw[fill=yellow!50] (0,0) circle (2cm);
  
  % Eyes
  \fill (-0.7,0.7) circle (0.2cm);
  \fill (0.7,0.7) circle (0.2cm);
  
  % Smile
  \draw (-1,-0.5) arc[start angle=200, end angle=340, radius=1cm];
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Again, if we want, we can also recall @fig-prime from @sec-lecture-one.
